Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Streamlit is a web-based interactive game where players can challenge an AI opponent or play against a friend locally. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure unbeatable performance at "Hard" difficulty. Built with Python and Streamlit, the app runs directly in the browser with a clean and responsive interface.
